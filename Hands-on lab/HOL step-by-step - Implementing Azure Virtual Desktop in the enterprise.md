# Implementing Azure Virtual Desktop for the enterprise hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement an Azure Virtual Desktop (formerly Windows Virtual Desktop) Infrastructure and learn how-to setup a working AVD environment end-to-end in a typical Enterprise model. At the end of the lab, attendees will have deployed an Azure Active Directory Tenant with Azure AD Connect to an Active Directory Domain Controller that is running in Azure. You will also deploy the Azure infrastructure for the Azure Virtual Desktop Tenant(s), Host Pool(s) and session host(s), and connect to an AVD session utilizing different supported devices and browsers. You will publish desktops and remote apps, and configure user profiles and file shares with FSLogix.  Finally, you will configure monitoring and security for the Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure and understand the steps to manage the gold images.

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will deploy the [Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/) solution. Exclusively available as an Azure cloud service, Azure Virtual Desktop allows you to choose a flexible end user virtualized application or desktop delivery model that best aligns with your enterprise Azure cloud strategy. AVD simplifies the IT model to virtualize and deploy modern and legacy desktop app experiences with unified management without needing to host, install, configure, and manage components such as diagnostics, networking, connection brokering, and gateway. AVD brings together Microsoft Office 365 and Azure to provide users with the only multi-session Windows 10 experience with exceptional scale and reduced IT costs while empowering today's modern digital workspace.

## Solution architecture

![This is the Solution architecture diagram as described in the text below.](images/avdsolutiondiagramv2.png "Solution architecture") 

This diagram shows an Azure Virtual Desktop architecture with on-premises servers for Active Directory.  In the diagram, the host pools are providing the AVD session to the different supported devices. Azure Monitor, Network Watcher, and Log Analytics are monitoring and logging activity and performance metrics.

## Requirements

Before you start setting up your Azure Virtual Desktop workspace, make sure you have the following items:

-   The Azure Active Directory tenant ID for Azure Virtual Desktop users.

-   A global administrator account within the Azure Active Directory tenant.

    -   This also applies to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) organizations that are creating an Azure Virtual Desktop workspace for their customers. When you are in a CSP organization, you must be able to sign in as global administrator of the customer\'s Azure Active Directory tenant.

    -   The administrator account must be sourced from the Azure Active Directory tenant in which you are trying to create the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace. This process does not support Azure Active Directory B2B (guest) accounts.

    -   The administrator account must be a work or school account.

-   An Azure subscription.

    -   Enough Quota Cores to build four 4-core servers.

    -   Access to the Azure Active Directory Global Admin account for your new or existing Azure Active Directory Tenant.

    -   Owner rights on all Azure subscription(s).

## Before the hands-on lab

-   Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide before continuing to the lab exercises.
  
-   Make sure to keep track of what user accounts you are using and where you are using them.

-   Regions and locations, make sure to stay consistent as much as possible.

## Troubleshooting

When you run into issues with your Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environment, there will periodically be troubleshooting tips at the end of the current exercise.  If the issues are not directly addressed, please feel free to reach out to your instructor or teacher.

Review the article, [Troubleshooting overview, feedback, and support for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/troubleshoot-set-up-overview). Part of the article will cover steps used in [Exercise 8](#exercise-8-setup-monitoring-for-avd) and can help diagnose issues you may encounter.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Connect with AD DS

Duration:  60 minutes

In this exercise, you will be configuring [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect). With Azure Virtual Desktop, all session host VMs within the AVD tenant environment are required to be domain joined to AD DS, and the domain must be synchronized with Azure AD. To manage the synchronization of objects, you will configure Azure AD Connect on the domain controller deployed in Azure.

>**Note**: RDP access to a domain controller using a public IP address is not a best practice and is only done to simplify this lab. Better security practices such as removing the PIP, enabling just-in-time access and/or leveraging a bastion host should be applied enhance security.

|Azure Virtual Desktop (ARM-based model) deployment walk through |https://www.christiaanbrinkhoff.com/2020/05/01/windows-virtual-desktop-technical-2020-spring-update-arm-based-model-deployment-walkthrough/#NewAzurePortal-Dashboard |
  |              |            | 

### Task 1: Connecting to the domain controller

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Type **Resource groups** in the search field and select it from the list.

3.  On the Resource groups blade, select the resource group name that you created in the **Before the HOL** template deployment.

4.  On the Infra Resource group blade, review the list of available resources. Locate the resource named **AdPubIP1** and select it. Note that the resource type should be **Public IP address**.

    ![This image shows how to find the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](images/publicip.png "Public IP address for Domain Controller VM")

5.  On the Overview page for AdPubIP1, locate the **IP address** field. Copy the IP address to a safe location.

6.  On your local machine, open the **RUN** dialog window, type **MSTSC** and enter.

    ![This image shows the Run dialog window to run MSTSC.](images/run.png "Run on Windows") 

7.  In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste in the public IP address from the previous step. Select **Connect**.

    ![This image shows how the Window for Remote Desktop Connection will open to enter the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](images/remoteDesktop.png "Window for Remote Desktop Connection") 

8.  When prompted, sign in with the AD domain UPN credentials. For example, when you used the ARM template from [Before HOL setup guide](), the credentials will be something along the lines of: [adadmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:adadmin@MyADDomain.com) with the password: **AVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. If prompted, select **Yes** to accept the RDP certification warning.

    >**Note**: This is the Active Directory account from the ARM template, not the Azure AD Global Admin account. when you have trouble signing in, try typing the credentials in manually, as copy and paste may include an unnecessary space, which will cause authentication to fail.

### Task 2: Disabling IE Enhanced Security

To simplify tasks in this lab, we will start by disabling [IE Enhanced Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-esc).

1.  Once connected to the domain controller, open Server Manager if it does not start automatically.

2.  In Server Manager, select **Local Server** on the left.

3.  Locate the **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** option and select **On**.

    ![This image shows the Local Server properties in server manager, locate Enhanced Security configuration.](images/IEESC.png "Local Server properties within server manager") 

4.  On the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration window, under **Administrators**, select the **Off** radio button and select **OK**.

    ![This image shows how you select the current configuration, a new window will open that will allow you to disable the enhanced security configuration.](images/disablesecurity.png "Disable enhanced security configuration")

### Task 3: Creating a domain admin account

By default, Azure AD Connect does not synchronize the built-in domain administrator account [ADAdmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:ADAdmin@MyADDomain.com). This system account has the attribute isCriticalSystemObject set to *true*, preventing it from being synchronized. While it is possible to modify this, it is not a best practice to do so.

1.  In Server Manager, select **Tools** in the upper right corner and select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![This image shows how to find Tools on the upper right corner to access the Server Manager Tools.](images/serverMangerTools.png "Server Manager Tools") 

2.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click the **Users** organization unit and select **New \> User** from the menu.

    ![In this image, you find the folder path for users, and right-click to add a new user.](images/newUser.png "Folder path for new user") 

3.  Complete the New User wizard.

    ![This image shows the window that will open with the fields to complete for a new user.](images/newuserobject.png "Create a new user")

    ![This image is the next window that will allow you to assign a password.](images/newUserWizard.png "New User Wizard window") 

    ![This image shows the final screen of the wizard will allow you to review and finish the new user setup.](images/finishnewuser.png "Finish new user setup")

    >**Note**: This account will be important in future tasks. Make a note of the username and password you create. When setting the password, uncheck the box **User must change password at next logon**.

4.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click on the new user account object and select **Add to a group**.

    ![This image shows when the new user is created, we will find that username and right-click to add the user to a group.](images/addusertogroup.png "Add new user to a group")

5.  On the Select Groups dialog window, type **Domain Admins** and select **OK**.
   
    >**Note**: This account will be used during the host pool creation process for joining the hosts to the domain. Granting Domain Admin permissions will simplify the lab. However, any Active Directory account that has the following permissions will suffice. This can be done using [Active Directory Delegate Control](https://danielengberg.com/domain-join-permissions-delegate-active-directory/). 

    ![This image shows how we will add this user to the Domain Admins group.](images/addusertodomainadmins.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

### Task 4: Configuring Azure AD Connect

1.  On the desktop of the domain controller, locate the icon for **Azure AD Connect** and open it.

    ![This image shows the Azure AD Connect icon on the Domain controller VM desktop.](images/azureadconnect.png "Azure AD Connect desktop icon")

    >**Note**: The installation of Azure AD Connect may fail if the server has not been updated to enable TLS 1.2.  If this is the case, run the following PowerShell script to enable and then re-open Azure AD Connect.

    ```
    New-Item 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -Force | Out-Null

	New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -name 'SystemDefaultTlsVersions' -value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null

	New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client' -name 'DisabledByDefault' -value 0 -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null
	Write-Host 'TLS 1.2 has been enabled.'
    ```

2.  Accept the license terms and privacy notice, then select continue. On the next screen select **Use express settings**. The required components will install.

    ![This image shows how the install wizard will take you to the Azure AD connect set up screen.](images/AzureADconnectExpressSetting.png "Azure AD connect set up screen") 

3.  On the Connect to Azure AD page, enter in the Azure AD Global Admin credentials. For example: [azadmin\@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:azadmin@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com) and the correct password. Select **Next**.

    ![This image shows how after selecting "Use express settings", the next window will require you to enter your Azure Active Directory username and password.](images/adconnectazuresub.png "Azure AD Connect - Azure AD login")
    >**Note**: This is the account associated with your Azure subscription.

4.  On the Connect to AD DS page, enter in the Active Directory credentials for a Domain Admin account. For example, when you used the ARM template deployment for the domain controller, the credentials will be something along the lines of: **[[MyADDomain.com]](http://myaddomain.com/) \\ADadmin** with the password: **AVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. Select **Next**.

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will enter the AD DS domain and admin username and password.](images/azureadconnectdclogin.png "Azure AD Connect - Domain login")
    
    >**Note**: When you copy and paste the password, make sure there are no trailing spaces, as that will cause the verification to fail.

5.  Select **Install** to start the configuration and synchronization.

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will select the box to continue without matching all UPN suffixes and select next to continue.](images/azureadsigninconfig.png "Azure AD sign-in configuration")

    ![This image shows the final setup window, select the box to start the synchronization process and select install.](images/azureadready.png "Azure AD Connect Ready to configure")

6.  After a few minutes, the Azure AD Connect installation will complete. Select **Exit**.

    ![This image shows the installation is complete the Configuration complete window will be present.](images/AADCcomplete.png "The Configuration is completed window")
    
7.  Minimize the RDP session for the domain controller and wait a few minutes for the AD accounts to be synchronized to Azure AD.

8.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

9.  Type **Azure Active Directory** in the search field and select it from the list.

10. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Users**.

11. Review the list of user account objects and confirm the test accounts have synchronized.  

    ![This image shows the list of users that you should see in Azure Active Directory that were synchronized from Active Directory with Azure AD Connect.](images/adconnectsync.png "Synchronized users list")

    >**Note**: It can take up to 15 minutes for the Active Directory objects to be synchronized to the Azure AD tenant.


## Exercise 2: Create Azure AD groups for AVD

Duration:  30 minutes

In this exercise, you will be working with groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to assist in managing access assignment to your application groups in AVD. The new ARM portal for AVD supports access assignment using Azure AD groups. This capability greatly simplifies access management. Groups will also be leveraged in this guide to manage
share permissions in Azure Files for FSLogix.

You will be creating three Azure AD groups to manage access to the different application groups: Personal, Pooled, and RemoteApp. For this guide we will only create a single group for RemoteApps, but in a production scenario it is more common to use separate groups based on the app or persona defined by the customer. Be sure to make note of the groups you create, as they will be used in later exercises.

It is also important to keep in mind that these groups can also originate from the Windows Active Directory environment and synchronize via Azure AD Connect. This will be another common scenario for customers that already have processes defined on-premises for group management.

### Task 1: Creating Azure AD groups

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3.  On the Azure Active Directory page, select **Groups** on the left and select **+ New group**.

4.  On the New Group page, fill in the following options and select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** AVD Pooled Desktop User

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![This image shows how to create a new security group type and provide the AVD Pooled Desktop user for the group name.](images/newGroup2.png "New Group Window")

5.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** AVD Remote App All Users

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![This image shows how to create a new security group type and provide the AVD Remote App All users for the group name.](images/newGroup1.png "New Group Window")

6.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** AVD Persistent Desktop User

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![This image shows how to create a new security group type and provide the AVD Persistent Desktop user for the group name.](images/newGroup3.png "New Group Window")

7. Confirm that the groups have been added by going to **Azure Active Directory**, selecting **Groups**.  Scroll down to the bottom of the list of groups and the three groups that you created should be listed.

    ![This image shows how to go to Azure Active Directory Groups to view the list of groups.](images/aadgroups.png "Azure Active Directory Groups")

    ![This image shows where to scroll to the bottom of the list to view the three new groups that were created.](images/aadnewgroups.png "Azure Active Directory Groups")

### Task 2: Assign users to groups

Now that the Azure AD groups are in place, you will assign users for testing. Once the groups are populated, you can leverage them for assigning access to AVD resources once they are created.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3.  On the **Azure Active Directory** page, select **Groups** on the left and select the **AVD Persistent Desktop User** group.

4.  Select **Members** and **+ Add Members**

    ![This image shows how to add members to the persistent desktop user group from within the Azure AD blade.](images/newMember.png "Azure AD blade")

5.  In the search field, enter the name of a User to add **Select** to add them to the group.

6.  Repeat steps 4-6 for the **AVD Pooled Desktop User** and **AVD Remote App All Users** groups.

    At this point you have three new Azure AD groups with members assigned. Make a note of the group names and accounts you added for use later in this guide. These groups will be used to assign access to AVD application groups.

    ![This image shows the list of users that you should be adding to each of the groups.](images/aadavdusers.png "Azure AD groups")


## Exercise 3: Create an Azure Files Share for FSLogix

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise, you will be creating an Azure File share and enabling SMB access via Active Directory authentication. Azure Files is a platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for hosting FSLogix containers for AVD users. At the end of this exercise, you will have the following components:

-   A new storage account in your Azure subscription.

-   A new Azure file share for your FSLogix profile containers.

-   AD authentication enabled for your Azure storage account.

-   Permissions applied for user access to the file share.

### Task 1: Create a storage account

Before you can work with an Azure file share, you need to create an Azure storage account. To create a general-purpose v2 storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to access the search menu bar, and search for storage accounts.](images/storageaccount.png "Search for storage accounts")

3.  On the Storage Accounts window that appears, select **+ Add**.

4.  Fill in the required parameters for the storage account. Refer to the following example for more information on the available parameters. Make a note that contains the values you provide for **Resource group** and **Storage account name**. These will be needed later in the exercise.

    ![This image shows how to select the Add icon to create a new storage account.](images/addstorageaccount.png "Add a storage account")

    ![This image shows how to enter the information to create a new storage account.](images/createstorageaccount.png "Create a storage account")
    
    >**Note**: The storage account name should be 15 characters or less in length.

5.  Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and create the account.

6.  Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure file share

1.  At the top of the Azure Portal page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, select the storage account you created in Task 1.

3.  On the Overview page for your Storage account, select **File shares**.

    ![This image shows that once the storage account is created, from the overview blade, to select File shares.](images/storagefileshare.png "Create a File share")

4.  On the File shares blade, select **+ File Share**.

    ![This image shows that you need to select the add icon in File shares to create a new file share.](images/addfileshare.png "Add file share")

5.  Enter a Name for the new file share, select **Hot** Tier, and select **Create**.

    ![This image shows how to give the file share a name and a storage quota in gigabits.](images/newfileshare.png "New File share")
    
    >**Note**: The file share quota supports a maximum of 5,120 GiB and can be managed on the File shares blade.

### Task 3: Enable AD authentication for your storage account

**Prerequisites**

1.  The steps in this task need to be completed from a domain joined computer. The **AzFilesHybrid** module uses the AD PowerShell module, so running from a server is preferred.

    ![This image shows how to locate the PowerShell ISE icon on the VM desktop and select it to open.](images/openpowersellise.png "Open PowerShell ISE")

2.  The account used in this task needs to meet the following requirements:

    -    Synchronized with Azure AD.

    -    Permissions to create user or computer objects in Active Directory.

    -    Owner or Contributor rights on the Storage account.

In this task, you will be completing the steps on the Domain Controller in Azure using an account that has been assigned Global Administrator and Domain Administrator. In a production environment, you can scale this back if you meet the minimum requirements above.

**Setup**

1.  From a domain joined computer, download, and unzip the [AzFilesHybrid module](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases).

    **Link address**: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases   

    ![This image shows the view of the GitHub site for Azure samples.](images/azfileshybriddownload.png "Azure samples")

2. From the GitHub repository, select and download the AzFilesHybrid.zip file to the domain joined computer **Documents** folder.

    ![This image shows that when prompted to save the file, select save as to choose the location.](images/filesaveas.png)

    ![This image shows that in the window that opens, you need to find the documents folder to save the file.](images/filedownload.png)

3. After the download is complete, navigate to the file location in file explorer.

    ![This image shows how to, after going to the GitHub link to download the AzFilesHybrid file, you locate this file in the folder it was saved.](images/azfileshybridzip.png "AzFilesHybrid module zip file")

4. Extract this file to the **Documents** folder on the local Domain controller.

    ![This image shows how to open the zip file and select extract all.](images/extractzipfile.png "Extract zip file to documents")

    ![This image shows how to choose the location to extract the files within the zip file to the documents folder.](images/extractlocation.png "Extract to documents")

5.  Open an elevated PowerShell ISE window by finding the **PowerShell ISE** icon on the desktop. Right-click on the icon and select **Run as administrator**.

    ![This image shows how to locate the PowerShell icon on the domain computer desktop, right-click and select run as administrator.](images/runasadministrator.png)

6.  Configure the PowerShell execution policy **Unrestricted** for the current user.

    ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

7.  Navigate to where you unzipped the AzFilesHybrid. For example:

    ```
    cd C:\Users\ADAdmin\Documents\AzFilesHybrid\AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![This image shows how the path to the file should be the documents folder location in file explorer.](images/filelocation.png "Documents folder path")

8.  Install the Az PowerShell module.

    ```  
    if ($PSVersionTable.PSEdition -eq 'Desktop' -and (Get-Module -Name AzureRM -ListAvailable)) {
    Write-Warning -Message ('Az module not installed. Having both the AzureRM and ' +
      'Az modules installed at the same time is not supported.')
    } else {
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
    }
    ```

9.  Install the AzFilesHybrid module.

    ```
    .\CopyToPSPath.ps1
    ```

10. Import the AzFilesHybrid module.

    ```  
    Import-Module -Name AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![This image shows that after running these commands, the results will look like this screenshot.](images/azimportresults.png "Command results")
    
11. Sign in with an account that meets the prerequisites.

    ```
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

12.  Create the following PowerShell variables replacing the subscription id, resource group name, and storage account with the information specific to your lab environment:
    

        ```
        $SubscriptionId = "<subscription-id>"
        $ResourceGroupName = "<resource-group-name>"
        $StorageAccountName = "<storage-account-name>"
        ```



        >**Note**: The Resource Group Name and Storage Account Name were assigned in Task 1.

        >**Note**: You can run **Get-AzSubscription** to lookup the available subscription names.

        ![This image shows where you would find the subscription Id when running the Get-AzSubscription command.](images/subscriptionid.png "Subscription Id")


13.  Select the target subscription for the current session.
  

        ```
        Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
        ```

14. Register the storage account with your Active Directory domain.

    ```
    Join-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName
   
    ```

    >**Note**: You will be prompted to enter the Azure storage account name after you run this command.  The prompt will look like the screenshot below.

    ![This image shows the prompt to enter the Azure storage account after running the join command.](images/enterstorage.png)

15. When the script completes, you will be provided with confirmation that you are connected to the storage account.

    ![This image shows the confirmation of the storage account connection.](images/storageconfirmed.png "Storage account confirmation")

16. Confirm the object was created successfully in **Active Directory Users and Computers** by going to Domain controllers and looking for the computer object for Azure storage account.

    ![This image is what the newly created computer object looks like in Active Directory.](images/confirmnewobject.png "Active Directory object")

17. Confirm that the feature is enabled.

        ```
        $storageaccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName
        ```

18.  List the directory service of the selected service account.
 
        ```
        $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.DirectoryServiceOptions
        ```

19. List the directory domain information if the storage account has enabled AD authentication for file shares.

    ```
    $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.ActiveDirectoryProperties
    ```

    ![This image is what the responses should be when running the previous PowerShell tasks.](images/confirmpowershell.png "PowerShell task responses")


20. Confirm activation with your domain by navigating to the Azure portal, going to the storage account and selecting **Files shares** under **Data storage**. Refer to the File share settings to see **Configured** on Active Directory (AD), as shown in the example below.

    >**Note**: You may need to navigate out of the storage account and back in for the File share settings to change.

    ![This image shows how in the storage account configuration, that Active Directory Domain Services is configured.](images/portalconfirm.png "Storage account configuration")

You have now successfully enabled AD authentication over SMB and assigned a custom role that provides access to an Azure file share with an AD identity.

### Task 4: Configure share permissions

There are three Azure built-in roles for granting share-level permissions to users and/or groups:

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Reader**: allows read access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor**: allows read, write, and delete access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor**: allows read, write, delete, and modify NTFS permissions in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

To access Azure Files resources with identity-based authentication, an identity (a user, group, or service principal) must have the necessary permissions at the share level. This process is similar to specifying Windows share permissions, where you specify the type of access that a particular user has to a file share. The guidance in this task demonstrates how to assign read, write, or delete permissions for a file share to an identity.

To simplify administration, create 4 new security groups in Active Directory to manage share permissions.

1.  From a domain joined computer, open **Server Manager**, then navigate to **Tools** to open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![This image shows how to navigate to Tools to be able to get to Active Directory Users and Computers to create a new group.](images/aduserscomputers.png "Active Directory Users and Computers under Tools")

2.  Under the local domain, select **Builtin** and select **Create a new group in the current container**.

    ![This image shows how to open the window on the domain controller VM server manager and go to the Active Directory users and computers to create a new security group.](images/adgroups.png "Create new groups")

3.  Create the following Active Directory security groups in an OU that is synchronized with Azure AD:

    -   **AZF FSLogix Contributor**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Contributor.](images/azfcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Contributor")

    -   **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor.](images/azfelevcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor")

    -   **AZF FSLogix Reader**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Reader.](images/azfreader.png "AZF FSLogix Reader")

    -   **AVD Users**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AVD User.](images/avduser.png "AVD User")

4.  Add the AVD administrative account that you created previously to the group **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. This account will have permissions to modify file share permissions.

    ![This image shows how to find the AVD admin user that you created previously and right-click to add to a group.](images/chooseadmin.png)

5.  Type **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** and select **Check Names** to verify. Select **Ok** to save.

    ![This image shows how to add the AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor group to this user.](images/addadmin.png)

6.  Add the group **AVD Users** to the group **AZF FSLogix Contributor** by going to the Builtin groups, locating AVDUsers and right-click to **Add to a group**.
  
    ![This shows how you would find the AVD Users group and add it to a group.](images/avduseraddtogroup.png)

    ![This image shows where you enter the FSLogix contributor group and check the name before adding.](images/avduseraddgroup.png)

7.  Add user accounts to the group **AVD Users** by selecting **OrgUsers** and choosing all the users in the list.  Select all the users and right-click to add them to a group. These users will have access to use FSLogix profiles. Also be sure to add the **ADAdmin** user to these groups.

    ![This image shows the list of users in the organization, select the users and add them to the AVD Users group.](images/avdaddusers.png "Add users to the AVD users group")

8.  Wait for the new groups to synchronize with Azure AD.  These groups can be verified by going to **Groups** within **Azure Active Directory** and looking for the names in the list.

    ![This image shows how to where you would verify that the groups that were created on the domain controller have synchronized with Azure AD.](images/newgroups.png)

    With the new security groups available in Azure AD, use the following steps to assign them to your storage account in the Azure portal. This will enable you to manage share permissions using AD security groups.

9.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to, from the Azure portal, search for storage accounts on the search bar.](images/storageaccount.png "Search for storage accounts")

10. On the Storage accounts blade, select the Storage account you created in Task 1.

11. On the blade for your storage account, locate and select **File shares**. Then, on the File shares blade, select your file share.

    ![This image shows how to, from the Storage account, locate File shares under Data storage in the menu and select your file share to adjust the settings.](images/avdselectfileshare.png "Navigate to file share settings")

12. Select **Access Control (IAM)**, and then select **+ Add** and select **Add role assignment**.

    ![This image shows that, in the storage account, under access control, you will locate and select add under add a role assignment.](images/addroleassign.png "Add Azure AD Role assignment")

13. On the Add role assignment fly out, fill in the following options and select **Save**.

    -    **Role**: Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor

    -    **Assign access to**: Azure AD user, group, or service principal

    -    **Select**: AZF FSLogix Contributor

    ![This image shows how to add the storage file data SMB share contributor role to the AZF FSLogix contributor role that were created within Active Directory.](images/azureadroleassigncontrib.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

14. Repeat steps 3-4 for the remaining two roles.

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor \> AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor

    ![This image shows how to add the storage file data SMB share elevated contributor role to the AZF FSLogix elevated contributor role that were created within Active Directory.](images/azureadroleassignelev.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Reader \> AZF FSLogix Reader

    ![This image shows how to add the storage file data SMB share reader role to the AZF FSLogix Reader role that were created within Active Directory.](images/azureadroleassignreader.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

### Task 5: Configure NTFS permissions for the file share

After you assign share-level permissions with Azure RBAC, you must assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level. Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper that determines whether a user can access the share. Whereas NTFS permissions act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can do at the directory or file level.

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advanced permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then using Windows File Explorer or running the Windows iCACLS or Set-ACL command.

The first time you configure NTFS permission, do so using superuser permissions. This is accomplished by mounting the file share using your storage account key.

>**Note**: To complete this task, you will need to disable secure transfer in the storage account.  This can be accessed from the storage account **Configuration** and selecting **Disabled** under **Secure transfer required**.  Select **Save** to save the changes.

![This image shows how, within the configuration, you will disable secure transfer required and save.](images/disablesecuretransfer.png "Disable secure transfer")

1.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, select the Storage account you created in Task 1.

3.  On the blade for the file share within your storage account, select **Connect**. This will open the **Connect** blade. 

    ![This image shows how to use the storage account properties blade to open the Connect blade.](images/connectstorage.png "Connect to storage")

>**Note**: The base URL is also available under the **Properties** of the storage account itself under the **File service** entry.  

4.  On the **Connect** blade, select Drive letter **Z**, **Storage account key** for the Authentication method. 
   
    ![This is an image of the drive letter and authentication method settings for connecting the storage account.](images/storagesettings.png "Storage connect settings")

5.  On the **Connect** blade for your storage account, copy the **PowerShell** script located in the gray text box.

    ![Here is the location of the script to copy to run in Windows PowerShell.](images/copyscript.png "Connect script")

6.  From a domain joined computer, open a **PowerShell** and enter **cd c:\users** and paste the **PowerShell** script that you copied from the **Connect** blade. 

    ``
    cd c:\users
    ``

    ![This image shows the pasting of the PowerShell script and the status of the connection.](images/powershellconnect.png "PowerShell file share connection")
     
    >**Note**: After running the script, if you receive a CMDKEY: Credential added successfully and drive name **Z** appears, the script has run correctly. If this fails it may be that this is an SMB connection on port 445 and many consumer ISPs block this port by default. When you are doing this in your lab and experience issues mounting the share from a local computer, try connecting from a domain joined VM in Azure. 

    ![This image shows how to, after the net use command is completed successfully, you will receive a prompt that it was completed successfully.  You will also be able to see the drive as a network location in file explorer.](images/successfulstoragemap.png "Connected network drive")

7.  Open **File Explorer**, right-click on the **Z:** drive and select **Properties**.

8.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

    ![This image shows how to, in the properties for the drive, select the security folder and select advanced.](images/drivesecurity.png "Network drive security settings")

9.  Select **Add** and add each of the AD security groups you created in Task 4 with the appropriate permissions.  Select check names as each is entered to verify the connection.

    ![This image shows how to select add in security settings to add new objects.](images/addsecurity.png "Add security principals")

    >**Note**: The images show all the objects that need to be added but only one can be added at a time.  Add one and then repeat the process until all four are added.

    | AD Group | NTFS Permissions | Applies to |
    |----------|------------------|------------|
    | **AZF FSLogix Contributor** | Modify | This folder, subfolders and files|
    | **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** | Full control |This folder, subfolders and files|
    | **AZF FSLogix Reader** | Read & execute |This folder, subfolders and files|
    | **AVD Users** | Modify (This folder only) |This folder only|

10. Select **OK** to save your changes. Select **Yes** if you receive a **Windows Security** warning about removal of inherited permissions.

    ![This image shows how to choose select a principal to open the select user, computer, service account, or group window.  In the enter the object name window, enter the FSLogix groups that were created previously.  Check names and select ok.](images/addobjects.png "Steps to add principal object permissions")

    ![This image shows how that after adding all four objects as principals, they will be in the list of permission entries.](images/addsecuritycomplete.png "New security permissions added")



### Task 6: Configure NTFS permissions for the containers

With the NTFS permissions applied at the root file share, you can now create the FSLogix folder structure and recommended NTFS permissions. There are many ways to create secure and functional storage permissions for use with Profile Containers and Office Container. Below is one configuration option that provides new-user functionality and doesn't require users to have administrative permissions.

In this task we will create directories for each of the FSLogix profile types and assign the recommended permissions.

1.  Navigate to the networked drive in File explorer.

    ![This is an image of where you will find the network drive that you mounted in the previous task.](images/networkdrive.png "Network drive location")

2.  Create three new folder directories in the root share.

    -    **Profiles**

    -    **ODFC**

    -    **MSIX**

    ![This image shows that after adding these folders, file explorer for that shared drive will look like this.](images/newfolders.png "New folders in drive z")

3.  Right-click on the **Profiles** directory and select **Properties**.

4.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

5.  Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

    ![This image is the screen that you would remove the inherited permissions.](images/removeinheritedperm.png "Remove inherited permissions")

6.  Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** and check **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows the selections that should be complete before selecting ok.](images/addfullcontrol.png "Set full control for FSLogix Elevated Contributor")

7.  Select **Add** and add **Creator owner**. Grant **Full Control** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows how the add the creator owner object.](images/addcreatorowner.png "Add Creator owner principal")

    ![This image shows how to set the permissions for full control to the creator owner.](images/addfullcontrolcreator.png "Grant full control to creator owner")

8.  Select **Add** and add **AVD Users**. Grant the following special permissions to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    -   Traverse folder / execute file

    -   List folder / read data

    -   Read attributes

    -   Create folders / append data

    ![This image shows the special permissions for AVD user.](images/userfolderpermissions.png "AVD users folder permissions")

9.  Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

    ![This image shows the list of permission objects that were just created.](images/permissionscomplete.png "Permissions for Profiles and ODFC folder")

10. Repeat steps 3-9 for the **ODFC** directory.

11. Right-click on the **MSIX** directory and select **Properties**.

12. On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

13. Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

    ![This image is the screen that you would remove the inherited permissions.](images/removeinheritedperm.png "Remove inherited permissions")

14. Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows the selections that should be complete before selecting ok.](images/addfullcontrol.png "Add FSLogix Elevated Contributor full control")

15. Select **Add** and add **AVD Users**. Grant **Read & execute** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows the custom permissions for the AVD users on the MSIX folder.](images/msixavdusers.png "Add AVD users permissions")

16. Confirm your permissions match the screenshots below.

    ![This image shows the list of permission objects that were just created for the MSIX folder.](images/msixpermissions.png "Permissions for MSIX folder")

17. Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

Your Azure Files Share is now ready for FSLogix profile containers. Copy the UNC path and add it to your FSLogix deployment (image, GPO, etc.).

## Exercise 4: Create a gold image for AVD

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise, you are going to walk through the process of creating a gold image for your AVD host pools. The basic concept for a gold image is to start with a clean base install of Windows and layer on mandatory updates, applications, and configurations. There are many ways to create and manage images for AVD. The steps covered in this exercise are going to walk you through a basic build and capture process that includes core applications and recommended configuration options for AVD.

### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  On the Azure portal home page, select **Create a resource**.

3.  On the New page, search for **Microsoft Windows 10**. Select **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909** or higher and **Create**.


    ![This image shows the window will display the creation of a New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909.](images/windows10VM.png "New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909")

    >**Note**: In this exercise we are selecting a base Windows 10 image to start with and installing Office 365 ProPlus using a custom deployment script. We are also using the latest available release of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, but you can choose the version based on your requirements.

4.  On the Create a virtual machine page, fill in the required fields shown below. 

    ![This image shows what your configuration should be for the virtual machine image.](images/win10vmcreate.png "Create virtual machine")

    >**Note**: Make a note of the **Username** and **Password** used to create the VM. This information will be required to access the VM after creation.

    >**Note**: This guide does not walk through the process of creating a VM in Azure. However, for **Inbound port rules**, be sure to allow **RDP (3389)**, or have a bastion host deployed for remote access.

    ![This image shows that, in the "Create a virtual machine" page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM, allow port 3389 as an inbound port.](images/windows10VMcreate.png "The 'Create a virtual machine' page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM")

5.  Select the checkbox to confirm eligible Windows 10 licensing and create the VM by selecting **Review + create**.

    ![This image shows the Windows 10 licensing confirmation and the selection to Review and create.](images/windows10licensing.png "Confirm Windows 10 licensing")

6.  Once the VM is successfully deployed, go to the resource, and connect using RDP. Sign in using the credentials you supplied when creating the VM.

    ![This image shows the select connect in the Windows 10 VM overview to RDP to the vm.](images/connectwin10vm.png "Connect to Windows 10 VM")

7.  Download the RDP file and open the RDP file to connect.

    ![This image shows the download RDP button and the file that is downloaded to connect to the vm.](images/connectrdp.png "Download and run RDP file")

### Task 2: Run Windows Update

Despite the Azure support teams best efforts, the Marketplace images are not always up to date. The best and most secure practice is to keep your gold image up to date.

1.  From your gold image VM, open the **Settings** app and select **Updates & Security**.

### Task 3: Prepare an AVD image

**Introduction to the script**

The authors for this content have developed a scripted solution to assist in automating some common baseline image build tasks. The script includes a UI form, enabling you to quickly select which actions to perform. The result will be a custom gold image that incorporates Microsoft's main business applications, along with the necessary
policies and settings for an optimized user experience.

The script and related tools are maintained in GitHub - [Download Link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/tree/master/Image-Build/Customizations) 

https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/tree/master/Image-Build/Customizations 

For additional documentation about the script (e.g., parameters, functions, etc.), refer to the comments in **Prepare-WVDImage.ps1**.

For troubleshooting script execution, refer to the following log directory on the target machine: **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep**.

This script leverages the [Local Group Policy Object (LGPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool) tool in the [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10) to apply settings in the image. The settings are documented and exported on the target machine under **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep\\LGPO**. This approach was taken to simplify troubleshooting, enabling you to leverage Group Policy Results.

The UI form offers the following actions:

## Exercise 5: Create a host pool for personal desktops

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise we will be creating an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool for personal desktops. This is a set of computers or hosts which operate on an as-needed basis. In a pooled configuration we will be hosting multiple non-persistent sessions, with no user profile information stored locally. This is where FSLogix Profile Containers provide the users profile to the host dynamically. This provides the ability for an organization to fully utilize the compute resources on a single host and lower the total overhead, cost, and number of remote workstations.

**Troubleshooting**

**Web client stops responding or disconnects**

Try connecting using another browser or client.

If issues continue even after you\'ve switched browsers, the problem may not be with your browser, but with your network. We recommend you contact network support.

**Web client keeps prompting for credentials**

If the Web client keeps prompting for credentials, follow these instructions:

1.  Confirm the web client URL is correct.

2.  Confirm that the credentials you\'re using are for the Azure Virtual Desktop environment tied to the URL.

3.  Clear browser cookies.

4.  Clear browser cache.

5.  Open your browser in Private mode.

## Exercise 8: Setup monitoring for AVD

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise, you will setup monitoring for our AVD host pools. There are multiple reasons why monitoring serves a critical role: troubleshooting, performance, security, etc. There are also multiple components that make up the AVD service, which can add some variation on how customers implement monitoring (e.g., adding additional third-party solutions). By the end of this exercise, you will have the following monitoring capabilities enabled:

-   Diagnostic logging for the AVD service

-   Azure Monitor for the session host VMs

-   Log Analytics Monitoring Agent for the session host VMs

### Task 1: Create a Log Analytics workspace

A Log Analytics workspace is required for each of the monitoring capabilities covered in this exercise. You have the option to stream log data into different workspaces if desired. There are several factors to consider around a single workspace versus multiple. For example, RBAC controls, query performance, report development, etc. For AVD
environments, it is common to have all monitor data pointing to a single dedicated workspace.

In this exercise we will create a dedicated workspace for our environment. When you already have a workspace created, move on to Task 2.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type \"**log analytics**\". Select **Log Analytics workspaces** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to search for log analytics and select the service from the Azure Portal search bar.](images/searchloganalytics.png "Search for Log Analytics")

3.  On the Log Analytics workspaces blade, select **+Add**.

    ![This image shows how within the Log Analytics blade, you will select add to create a new workspace.](images/createlogworkspace.png "Add a Log Analytics workspace")

4.  On the Create Log Analytics workspace blade, fill in the following information and select **Review + Create**.

    -    **Subscription:** Select the desired subscription for the Log Analytics workspace.

    -    **Resource Group:** Create a new resource group or select one from the list.

    -    **Name:** Enter a unique name for the workspace.

    -    **Region:** Select a region for the workspace.

5.  Select **Create**.

    ![This image shows how to select a resource group and enter a unique name for the Log Analytics workspace.](images/configlogworkspace.png "Configure the Log Analytics workspace")

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. Once complete, move on to task 2.

### Task 2: Enabling diagnostic logging for AVD

Like many other Azure services, AVD uses Azure Monitor for monitoring and alerts. To enable diagnostic data collection, you need to enable it for each ARM object that you want to monitor (e.g., Host pools, Application groups, and Workspaces). Once enabled, it can take a few hours for the data to appear in your workspace.

Each AVD ARM object has different diagnostic data categories available. For example, host pool objects will have a different set of options then Workspaces. Refer to the following table for a summary of each data category and their associated objects.

  |              |            |     |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Category**  |**Description**  |                                                                 **ARM Object(s)** |
  Checkpoint   |       Specific steps in the lifetime of an activity that were reached. For example, during a session, a user was load balanced to a particular host, then the user was signed on during a connection, and so on. |  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces
  Connection    |      When users initiate and complete connections to the service.    |                                                                                                                                             Host pools
  Error       |        Are users encountering any issues with specific activities? This feature can generate a table that tracks activity data for you if the information is joined with the activities.     |               Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces |
  Feed   |             Can users successfully subscribe to workspaces? Do users see all resources published in the Remote Desktop client?      |                                                                                     Workspaces |
  Host Registration  | Was the session host successfully registered with the service upon connecting?       |                                                                                 Host pools| 
  Management     |     Track whether attempts to change Azure Virtual Desktop objects using APIs or PowerShell are successful. For example, can someone successfully create a host pool using PowerShell?       |                  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces

    ![This image shows that from the domain controller VM, you will select insights under monitoring in the menu.](images/vminsights.png "Virtual Machine Insights")

5.  On the Insights blade, select **Enable**. This will initiate a validation check.

    ![This image shows the insights blade, where you will select enable to enable insights on the virtual machine.](images/enableinsights.png "Enable VM Insights")

    >**Note**: The virtual machine must be running to enable Azure Monitor.

6.  On the Insights setup page, fill in the following information and select **Enable**.

    -    **Workspace Subscription:** Select the desired subscription.

    -    **Choose a Log Analytics Workspace:** Select the workspace used in the previous task.

    ![This image shows the enable insights blade, where you will select the Log Analytics workspace and select enable.](images/vminsightsconfig.png "Log Analytics workspace configuration for VM Insights")

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. This can take 5-10 minutes. Once complete, you will see the following items configured on the VM:

**New VM Extensions Added**. Two new extensions are added to the VM Extensions blade in Azure.

**New Monitoring Agents Installed**. Two new agents are installed on the VM.

**Monitoring Agent Configured for Log Analytics** The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is configured for your log analytics workspace.

At this point you should have Azure Monitor enabled on at least one session host VM. To enable Azure Monitor for additional session hosts, repeat the above steps. For automation, leverage Azure Policy or PowerShell to enable monitoring on multiple VMs.

**Example Kusto Queries**

For a list of example queries, refer to the following Docs article:

[**Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature \| Example queries**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics#example-queries) 

**Troubleshooting**

- Go to your Log Analytics workspace, and then select **Logs**. The example query UI is shown automatically.
- Change the filter to **Category**.
- Select **Azure Virtual Desktop** to review available queries.
- Select **Run** to run the selected query.

Often during the deployment of AVD there may be challenges with either having machines join the domain or installing the agent via automation.

## Exercise 9: Improving your AVD environment

Duration:  60 minutes

In this exercise, you will our AVD experience bay utilizing additional features or tools with the host pools. AVD is designed to be a versatile platform to distribute and build your solution from, and these optional features allow you to enhance and/or secure the environment depending on your needs. By the end of this exercise, you will have the following features enabled:

- Autoscale pooled pool based on connections

- Centralized Application Management (MSIX App Attach)

- Protect your environment via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

### Task 1: Enabling Autoscale

In this task, you will create an Azure Automation account and Logic App that will regularly update the scaling of your pool based on the number of connections.  Azure Automation allows for the execution of scripts and commands with an identity related to the automation.  Logic App allows for regular execution of commands and tasks.  By combining these two resources, we allow for repetitive tasks of a detailed nature which will allow us to automatically increase and decrease the number of hosts in an AVD host pool based on demand of the environment.

1. Use PowerShell on a system with the [Azure Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-5.9.0) installed (such as from Exercise 3, Task 3).

2. Run the following command connect to Azure using the subscription of your AVD:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

3.  Use the following commands to download installation script for the Automation Account:

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".\AVDTemp" -Force
    Set-Location -Path ".\AVDTemp"
    $Uri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/master/wvd-templates/wvd-scaling-script/CreateOrUpdateAzAutoAccount.ps1"
    # Download the script
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Uri -OutFile ".\CreateOrUpdateAzAutoAccount.ps1"
    ```

4. Use the following to call the installation script with the appropriate parameters:

    ```powershell
    $LAWorkspace = Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace | ?{ $_.name -notlike "DefaultWork*" }
    $Params = @{
        "UseARMAPI"             = $true
        "Location"              = $LAWorkspace.location
        "WorkspaceName"         = $LAWorkspace.name       # Optional. If specified, Log Analytics will be used to configure the custom log table that the runbook PowerShell script can send logs to
    }

    .\CreateOrUpdateAzAutoAccount.ps1 @Params

    ```

5. Now that the Azure Automation account is created, keep the PowerShell window open in the background and go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in your browser to finish the setup.

    ![This image shows the return to the Azure Portal web page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

6. Go to the Azure Automation account.

    ![This image shows where to search to find the Azure Automation account in the portal.](images/automationAccount.png "Azure Portal")

7. Select Run As accounts under Account Settings.

8. Select **Create** to create a new account.

    ![This image shows where you will find the automation account and select Run As of the Automation Account.](images/createRunAs.png "Create Automation Run As Account")

  >**Note**: This process may take a few minutes, but you can track the progress.

9. When it is complete, there will be a resource named **AzureRunAsConnection**.

10. Selecting the **Azure Run As account**, you can see the application ID, tenant ID, subscription ID, and certificate thumbprint.

    ![This image shows the completed Run As Automation account.](images/AutomationRunAsDetails.png "Azure automation Run As account")

11. Go back to the PowerShell window from earlier.

12. Run the following code to download a script to create the Logic App:

    ```powershell
    $Uri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/master/wvd-templates/wvd-scaling-script/CreateOrUpdateAzLogicApp.ps1"
    # Download the script
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Uri -OutFile ".\CreateOrUpdateAzLogicApp.ps1"
    ```

13. Run the following code to use the script to create your Logic App:

    ```powershell
    $AADTenantId = (Get-AzContext).Tenant.Id

    $AzSubscription = (Get-AzContext).Subscription

    $ResourceGroup = Get-AzResourceGroup  "AVDAutoScaleResourceGroup"

    $AVDHostPool = Get-AzWvdHostPool | ?{ $_.HostPoolType -eq "Pooled" } | Select -First 1 | Get-AzResource

    }

    .\CreateOrUpdateAzLogicApp.ps1 @Params
    ```

14. After this script completes, go back to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home web page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

15. Find the Logic App that was created by the script.

    ![This image shows the search to access Azure Portal Logic App services.](images/logicApps.png "Azure Portal")

16. Select the **Logic app designer** link under Development Tools, you will see the graphical representation of the workflow created by the script.

17. You can select **Recurrence** to change how often the script runs.

18. Select the **Run** button to trigger the scaling immediately.

    ![This image shows the Logic App graphical design view.](images/logicAppDesigner.png "Logic App Designer")

19. View the occurrences of your runs by going back to the **Overview** of the Logic App.

    ![This image shows the opening of the Logic App overview that will show the Run History and see previous runs.](images/logicAppOverview.png "Logic App Overview")

At this point, your AVD Host Pool that is Pooled will spin up and down hosts based on the load of the environment.

### Task 2: Utilizing Application Packages (MSIX)

In this task, you will take a **MSIX package** created from the [MSIX packaging tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/packaging-tool/tool-overview) and utilize the Azure portal to attach the MSIX package dynamically to AVD pools as users login.  MSIX Packages are disk images containing all files, configurations, and publication details needed to run supported applications that can be mounted by Windows systems on the fly to allow users to run the application without having to install the application to the host machine. By utilizing this technique, we can minimize the footprint and management needs of the AVD hosts while still utilizing multiple applications on the systems without installing the applications permanent on the system.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home web page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

2. Go to the **Storage Account** created in Exercise 3 for the FSLogix profiles that was already joined to Active Directory.

3. Select the **File shares** under data storage and select the share created for AVD files.

    ![This image shows that you will open share for AVD File Share on storage account.](images/avdFileShare.png "AVD File Share")

4. Select the **+ Add directory** button to create a new folder and name it **msix**.

    ![This image shows where to add a directory on storage account.](images/avdFileShareAdd.png "File Share add directory")

    > **Note:** Normally in production you would create an additional share for MSIX files and place the files there.  You would need to make sure the share or container the MSIX files are in you follow the same steps you use for the FSLogix storage account and apply the appropriate permissions to them (users normally only need Read access) and make sure there is enough room to store them.  We are placing it on the same share for this exercise for expediency sake and easier setup. It is not uncommon to have a central MSIX storage with permissions to each MSIX file based on groups assigned to the appropriate application and the MSIX repository used by multiple pools or deployments, but ensure network connectivity and speed are kept consistent.

5. Take note of the storage account (i.e.: `dncloudavdstorage` ) and the name of the file share (i.e.: `labavdfileshare`).

6. Open a PowerShell window with the Azure Module installed and connect to the Azure subscription with this command if it is not already connected:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

7. Run this command to upload the MSIX file to the folder:

    ```powershell
    $SAName = Read-Host "What is the name of the storage account with AVD file shares? (ie: mystorageacct1592)" # Provide the name to the storage account here instead of prompting
    $SAShare = Read-Host "What is the name of the file share in the storage account used for AVD? (ie: labavdfilesshare)"

    $sa = Get-AzStorageAccount | ? StorageAccountName -eq $SAName
    $SAS = New-AzStorageAccountSASToken -Context $sa.Context -Service File -ResourceType Object -Permission rwd -Protocol HttpsOnly -ExpiryTime ((Get-Date).AddHours(4))

    .\azcopy.exe copy 'https://openhackpublic.blob.core.windows.net/windows-virtual-desktop/msix/MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd' "https://$($sa.StorageAccountName).file.core.windows.net/$SAShare/msix/MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd$SAS"

    "\\$($sa.StorageAccountName).file.core.windows.net\$SAShare\msix\MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd" | scb
    Write-Output "Use the path [\\$($sa.StorageAccountName).file.core.windows.net\$SAShare\msix\MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd] later in this exercise"
    pause
    ```

8. Find the **Azure Virtual Desktop** resources.

9. Select the **Host pools** and select the Pooled host pool.

    ![This image shows the selecting Host Pools of Azure Virtual Desktop.](images/avdHostPools.png "AVD Host Pools")

10. Select the **Pooled** host pool.

    ![This image shows the selecting Pooled host pools of Azure Virtual Desktop.](images/avdPooledPool.png "Pooled host pool")

11. Go to  **MSIX packages** under the Manage section and select **+ Add** to add an MSIX package to the pool.

    ![This image shows where to go for the MSIX packages section and select add a package.](images/avdAddMSIXPackages.png "AVD add MSIX package")

12. In the MSIX image path, put the following path replacing `<storageacctname>` with the name over the Storage Account and `<shareName>` with the share that holds the MSIX above:

    ```markdown
    \\<storageacctname>.file.core.windows.net\<shareName>\msix\MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd
    ``` 
    
13. Select the **MSIX Package** to add.

    ![This image shows where to select the MSIX package to add.](images/avdAddMSIXPackage.png "Add MSIX package")

14. Ensure there is an application listed under **Package applications**.

15. For **Registration type**, select **On-demand registration**.

16. Under **State**, select **Active**.

17. Select **Add** to add the package.

    ![This image shows the settings for adding application package to AVD.](images/avdAddPackageSettings.png "Add MSIX settings")

18. Go to the **Application groups** and select **remoteapps**.

    ![This image shows where to select AVD Application Group.](images/avdApplicationGroup.png "Go to Application group")

19. Select **+ Add** to add an application.

    ![This image shows where to Add Application Group.](images/avdAddApplication.png "Add application")

20. Choose **MSIX package** from the Application source.

21. Select the MSIX package and MSIX application you just added.

22. Ensure the **Application name** matches the name.

23. Select **Save** to include

    ![This image shows how to set the MSIX application settings and select Save.](images/avdSaveMSIXApp.png "Setup MSIX application")

24. Go to the [AVD Web Client](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient) (or AVD client if installed locally).

25. Select the new application icon to launch the application (refresh the page if the new application does not show up).

This application is now running on the host pool although the application itself is not installed to the host system.  This allows for the application to also be updated by changing which MSIX package the application points to and the next time a user logs into the application. 

### Task 3: Protect AVD with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

In this task, you will enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service and deploy the endpoint protection via Azure. This will allow for all systems to be protected by the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service from potential vulnerabilities and alert in the event of suspicious execution or activity.

> **Note:** This will require signing up for [Azure Defender trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/enable-azure-defender#to-enable-azure-defender-on-your-subscriptions-and-workspaces) on your subscription.  If this is a Visual Studio subscription or you do not want to sign up for the time trial yet, you will need to wait and deploy this when you can sign up for the Azure Defender trial.


1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

2. Open the Azure **Security Center** (ASC) service.

    ![In this image, you are searching and navigating to Azure Security Center (ASC)](images/findAsc.png "Azure Security Center")

3. Go the **Azure Defender** under the Cloud Security section.

4. Select **Enable Azure Defender** to setup the trial edition of Azure Defender for your subscription.

    ![This image shows how to navigate to the Azure Defender section to enable the trial of Azure Defender.](images/enableAzureDefender.png "Enable Azure Defender")

5. Go back to **Azure Defender**.

6. Under the Advanced protection section, select **VM vulnerability assessment** where it lists the unprotected count of systems.

    ![This image shows how to where to select the VM assessment of Security Center to deploy to VMs.](images/defenderVMassesment.png "VM assessment")

7. Check the boxes next to all the VMs that host the AVD Host pools.

8. Select **Fix** to proceed to deployment of the agent.

    ![This image shows the VMs to choose for the hosts of the AVD and fix VMs to enable a vulnerability assessment.](images/defenderFixVMs.png "Fix defender for vulnerability assessment on AVD VMs")

9. Select the **Qualys** agent for deploying to Azure Defender and select **Proceed**.

    ![In this image, you are choosing the Qualys agent that is included with the Azure Defender for servers.](images/defenderSelectQualys.png "Choose Qualys")

10. Select **Fix X resources** to begin the deployment of the agent.

    ![This image shows the final step to ensure the VMs expected to be fixed after completing the previous steps.](images/deployDefenderByFix.png "Fix VMs with defender")

This will begin deploying Azure Defender to the Virtual Machines currently deployed.  Depending on your AVD environment, you can deploy them to systems as they are added to your domain in the AVD OU by utilizing Group Policies using the [domain group policy scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/onboard-windows-10-multi-session-device?view=o365-worldwide#scenario-2-using-domain-group-policy).  Another option when your host is not persistent or deployed from an image, is to use the instructions for [onboarding non-persistent VDI devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-endpoints-vdi?view=o365-worldwide).
