# Implementing Azure Virtual Desktop in the enterprise

Contoso Healthcare, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, is a national healthcare provider with a network of affiliate hospitals and doctor’s offices located throughout North America. These locations continue to grow through acquisition.  The nature of their business requires a high level of security of personal identifiable information (PII) for their employees.

Contoso currently has approximately 250 workstations within their environment with business applications for non-clinical users from the Developer, Finance, and Knowledge departments. Contoso is currently supporting existing data centers in California and Northern Virginia with VMware for the server control plane and a partial deployment of Citrix virtual desktop infrastructure. These locations are connected with a private WAN connection and a backup VPN over broadband.

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will gain experience designing solutions for Azure Virtual Desktop utilizing Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies.

The following components will need to be determined as part of the solutions. The first will consist of Microsoft 365 subscription that will be required to deliver the security requirements, Azure Active Directory, applications, and Windows licensing to users. Next, the Azure infrastructure that is required to support the Azure Virtual Desktop environment will need to be configured. Finally, the networking requirements will need to be determined for connectivity to the current on-premises infrastructure for application servers, and proper access to the user desktops and on-premises network with high security and limited latency.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to leverage various Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies together to build a secure, complex and robust Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure.

### Whiteboard design session

In the whiteboard design session, you will work in groups to design an Azure Virtual Desktop solution using Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies. Your solution will consider the necessary Microsoft 365 subscription required for Windows 10 Enterprise multi-user licensing, as well as the Azure Active Directory and security needs for a healthcare provider.  You will need to determine how to connect Azure to the current VMware and Citrix on-premises infrastructure and the connections needed to connect this infrastructure to Azure for application access. Finally, you will need to design the Azure Virtual Desktop solution utilizing Azure virtual machines with availability and scalability to handle 24x7 operations without performance degradation.

At the end of the whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a solution that leverages Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies together to build a secure and robust Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure.

### Hands-on lab

In the hands-on lab, you will implement an Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure that meet the requirements of the organization.  This will include assigning the appropriate Microsoft 365 subscription needed for Windows 10 multi-user licensing.  The proper Azure Active Directory role needed to create and configure the resources within the Microsoft 365 and Azure subscriptions will need to be assigned.  You will need to create the network infrastructure to connect the Azure network to the on-premises network, and allow users to access the Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure within Azure.  The Azure virtual machine infrastructure will need to be deployed to the Azure Virtual Desktop architecture standards.  Finally, you will create a standard image for the Azure Virtual Desktop.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build a secure and robust Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure.
